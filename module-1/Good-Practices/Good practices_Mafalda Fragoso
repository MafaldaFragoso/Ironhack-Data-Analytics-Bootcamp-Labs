# Variable naming
- Class names should normally use the CapWords convention
- Give meaningful names to the variables 

# Function naming
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability

# Indentation
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level
- Spaces are the preferred indentation method

# Line break
- Break before binary operators
- Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
- The closing parenthesis on multiline constructs may either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list

# Maximum Line Length
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters

# Imports
- Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.
- Imports should usually be on separate lines
- Should be grouped in following order:Standard library imports; Related third party imports; Local application/library specific imports.

# Libraries
- Standard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always use absolute imports

# Whitespace
- Do not use a space between print and the brackets
- Do not use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an unannotated function parameter

# Blank lines
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines
- Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line

# Others
- It's better to use or than | as it will work more universally
